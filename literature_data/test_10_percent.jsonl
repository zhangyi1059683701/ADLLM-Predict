The Process Descriptions is The process was also evaluated in an anaerobic digestion system (ADS) consisting of a stainless steel tubular reactor with a total volume of 30 L into which 20 L of a (50:50) mixture of FVW and meat residues (MR) was initially packed. After the initial period of operation (20 days), the ADS was inoculated with cow manure (10% v/v) to enrich the methanogenic population. The reactor was stirred by re-circulating the FVW twice a day. The pH was set at 7 and was maintained by the addition of a NaOH (0.8 N) solution when the ADS was started. Later in the process, the pH was naturally regulated by the metabolic intermediates produced during digestion. The bioreactor was kept at room temperature and operated in a fed batch mode. To avoid inhibition due to metabolic products and to ensure a sufficient supply of organic matter, 2.5 kg of different compositions of fresh feedstock mixtures were fed periodically (approximately every 12–15 days), and an equal volume of exhausted sludge was removed..
