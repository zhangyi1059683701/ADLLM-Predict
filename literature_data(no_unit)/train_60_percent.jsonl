The input dataset was prepared based on the operational results of four laboratory-scale AD reactors that were operated for 631 days. The reactor with a working volume of 2 L was operated in continuous mode and the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was gradually reduced from 20 days to 7.5 days. Diluted cheese whey (5-g COD/L) was used as the organic substrate. Two DIET stimulation strategies were applied: supplemental magnetite and external voltage application. Initial operating conditions were different for each reactor: untreated RC, magnetite-supplemented RM (20 mM as Fe), RE with external voltage (0.6 V between anode and cathode), and RME with both magnetite supplementation and external voltage application. after severe process imbalance (i.e., reduced methane production and VFA accumulation) was observed in RC and RE, both reactors were operated from day 94 and 504, respectively. After severe process imbalance (i.e., reduced methane production and VFA accumulation) was observed in RC and RE, the two reactors were continuously supplemented with magnetite (20 mM as Fe., the data is 497, 63, 497, 20, 0.6, 0.25, 98.4", "input": "", "output": "287.4"}
