The Process Descriptions is To reflect the fact that it takes some time for microbial community structure to change under DIET stimulation conditions, in particular, three different operating time-based variables were considered as key input data in this study; time of operation after the addition of magnetite (Time_revised_Fe3O4), time of operation from the initial point (Time_original), and hydrodynamic conditions (Time_original), and the time since the hydraulic conditions were changed (Time_revised). If there is no change in reactor operating conditions, the time variable need not be considered an important parameter, since longer run times will result in more stable process performance. However, it is critical to consider the above three time-based variables in a reactor where process performance can deteriorate due to harsh conditions (e.g., shortened hydraulic residence time) and this deteriorated performance can be recovered by external stimuli (e.g., DIET stimulation). The input dataset was prepared based on the operational results of four laboratory-scale AD reactors that were operated for 631 days. The reactor with a working volume of 2 L was operated in continuous mode and the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was gradually reduced from 20 days to 7.5 days. Diluted cheese whey (5-g COD/L) was used as the organic substrate. Two DIET stimulation strategies were applied: supplemental magnetite and external voltage application. Initial operating conditions were different for each reactor: untreated RC, magnetite-supplemented RM (20 mM as Fe), RE with external voltage (0.6 V between anode and cathode), and RME with both magnetite supplementation and external voltage application. after severe process imbalance (i.e., reduced methane production and VFA accumulation) was observed in RC and RE, both reactors were operated from day 94 and 504, respectively. After severe process imbalance (i.e., reduced methane production and VFA accumulation) was observed in RC and RE, the two reactors were continuously supplemented with magnetite (20 mM as Fe., the data is 570, 66, 570, 20, 0.0, 0.25, 97.6", "input": "", "output": "313.5"}
